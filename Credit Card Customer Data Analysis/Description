Our client is a credit card company. They have brought us a dataset that includes some demographics and recent financial data, over the past 6 months, for a sample of 30,000 of their account holders.
Whether, in the next month after the 6 month historical data period, an account owner has defaulted, or in other words failed to make the minimum payment.
Our goal is to develop a predictive model, whether an account will default next month, given demographics and historical data.
